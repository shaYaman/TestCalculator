# Test Calculator
## Cypress testing suit for calculator

<br>
1. Installation (https://docs.cypress.io/app/get-started/install-cypress):

`npm install cypress --save-dev`

This will install latest cypress version.<br>
Because the latest version doesn't support my OS version, i installed earlier version which is committed in my repository.<br><br>
Due to cypress limitation the test files are under:<br>
`cypress/integration/??ShaiCalculator*.js`

2. Running the test:

`npx cypress run`
