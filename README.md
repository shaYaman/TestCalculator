# TestCalculator
## Cypress testing suit for calculator


1. Installtion (https://docs.cypress.io/app/get-started/install-cypress):

`npm install cypress --save-dev`

This will install latest cypress version.
Because the latest version doesn't support my OS version, i installed earlier version which is committed in my repository.

2. Running the test:

`npx cypress run`
